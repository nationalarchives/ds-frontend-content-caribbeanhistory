<meta name="DC.description" content="This exhibition looks at the history of the British Caribbean through Colonial Office government documents held at The National Archives, focusing on the period between 1780 and 1926. Topics included are the Transatlantic Slave Trade, colonialism, political conflicts, and struggles for freedom. Documents used include public and private correspondence, petitions, maps, reports, sketches and photographs. The website contains some 50 images, as well as a Glossary, Bibliography, and Links to other sites.This page looks at society and the welfare of the population after slavery. Working classes suffered from high unemployment, low wages, high taxes, and few rights, which lead to unrest. Improvements were seen in judicial systems, police forces, education, health care, sanitation, etc. Social reform did not end punishment, which was conducted by state instead of slave owners." />

			<p>During slavery, <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#plantation">plantation</a> owners decided what kind of shelter and medical care was given to their slaves. After the abolition of slavery most available work was on the very same plantations that former enslaved people had worked on; the wages were low, and people had inadequate rights to land. Rent and taxes were high, as was unemployment. The <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#morant_bay_rebellion">Morant Bay rebellion</a> in Jamaica was one example of the working classes protesting about such conditions.</p>
			
			<p>From the middle to late 1800s, the Caribbean saw many changes. Colonial governments reformed judicial systems, police forces, education and health care.  They built roads and railways, developed botanical gardens, improved water supplies and sanitation, and established cable communication. Authorities introduced mass vaccinations against common diseases, and provided relief following natural disasters. </p>
			
			<p>Throughout the Caribbean, mental health institutions often suffered from poor standards of care, over crowding and patient neglect. By the 1870s many islands were constructing new facilities and attempting to improve patient care.</p>
			
			<p>Despite reform, abuse of the system continued. For example, forced labour and flogging were still prevalent in prisons. Such punishments were now conducted by the state instead of slave owners. In 1870s St. Lucia, a man was publicly flogged in the market place for practising <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#obeah">Obeah</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The schooling system established during slavery was expanded to teach Christian morals to the recently freed slaves. Later, academic and agricultural schools were instituted by the state.  The Mico Charity was an important educational trust that established schools in the British Caribbean.</p>
