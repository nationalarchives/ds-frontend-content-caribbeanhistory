			<p>This exhibition is based on Colonial Office documents held at The National Archives â€” home to records belonging to the British Government. The documents we have used in this exhibition are correspondence from administrators of local governments in the British West Indies, and date from 1692-1921.  While the documents give an interesting insight into Caribbean history, they also show the views of local people, particularly those concerned  with trade and in governance. Those in power were mainly of a particular class, social standing or political allegiance, and the documents reflect this bias. However, there are stories of a more diverse nature, and the Colonial Office archive does include voices from different parts of society, including indigenous and enslaved peoples, through to women and the poor.</p>
