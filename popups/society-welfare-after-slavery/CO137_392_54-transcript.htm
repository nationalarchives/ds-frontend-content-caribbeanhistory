        <p>State of the  Island.<br />
          ________ <br />
          Public Meetings!<br />
          St. Thomas ye  East,<br />
          AND<br />
          St. Ann’s Bay.<br />
          A Requisition numerously signed,<br />
          for a Public Meeting, to consider<br />
          “the condition of the people,”  having<br />
          been presented to the Custos of St.<br />
          Thomas ye East, his Honor has, we <br />
          learn, appointed the Meeting for  that<br />
          purpose, at Morant Bay.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>                                    But  we fear they<br />
          have been deceived and misled, and<br />
          the consequence is a serious  grievance<br />
          to our people; but we advise them  to <br />
          be prudent, yet firm, in their  remon-<br />
          strances, and we have no doubt that<br />
          “Truth” will ultimately prevail.<br />
             People of St. Ann’s,<br />
             Poor people of St. Ann’s,<br />
             Starving people of St. Ann’s,<br />
             Naked people of St. Ann’s,<br />
          You who have no Sugar Estates to<br />
		  work on, nor can find other employ.<br />
		  ment – We call on YOU to come<br />
		  forth</p>
