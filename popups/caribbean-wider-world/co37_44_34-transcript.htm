        <p>            By<br />
            the Observations, I have  been enabled to make –<br />
upon this Island, and it’s natural Advantages,<br />
during a Residence of five years, I am grounded<br />
in my Opinion, that this Island is a Post of the<br />
greatest Consequence, to His Majesty’s Naval <br />
and Commercial Interests.</p>
        <p>            The Recent  Evacuation of the French<br />
          from St. Domingo to North America, the many<br />
          Prizes brought in here by a few Privateers only,<br />
          corroborates the above fact, that if a Naval Force<br />
          was situated here, the Communication between<br />
          the United States of America &amp; the West Indies,<br />
          would be greatly interrupted, if not totally cut<br />
          off.</p>
