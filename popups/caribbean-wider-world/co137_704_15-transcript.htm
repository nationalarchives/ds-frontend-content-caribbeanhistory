	    <h2>Transcript:</h2>
	   
        <p>…complaints by  Cayman Islands Fishermen and the alleged<br />
irregularities  by Cayman Islands fishing vessels operating<br />
off the Island  of San Andr&eacute;s.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>It appears that there are five Cays or Reefs, called<br />
		  Boxanova,  Seranilla, Serrannah, Roncadora, and Quitaseno<br />
          which are  uninhabited and over which the Colombian Govern-<br />
          ment exercise a  claim.</li>
          <li>These Cays are situated some distance away from
        the Colombian  shores and used to be frequented by Fishermen<br />
          from the Lesser  Cayman Islands in search of hawksbill<br />
          turtle.</li>
          <li>I am led to understand that fishing operations
        are now, and  have been for some long time past entirely<br />
          confined to  Nicaraguan waters, and that there have been no<br />
          reports since  the late Dr. Wirst’s confidential letter No: 5<br />
          of the 17th  November 1911 of any friction or misunderstand-<br />
          ings of any  nature whatsoever between the Colombian Govern-<br />
          ment and the  Cayman Islands Fishermen.</li>
          <li>I am not aware of the enforcement of any fresh re-
        gulations since  last year nor indeed of the existence of<br />
          any regulations.</li>
		 </ol>
        <p>The Hon’ble                                             I  have, etc:,<br />
          The Colonial  Secretary,                          Sgd: A.C. Robinson.<br />
          Jamaica.                                                        Commissioner.</p>
