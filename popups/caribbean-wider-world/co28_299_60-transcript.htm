		<h1>Despatch regarding case of the wife of 'coloured' Barbadian, extract. Barbados, 1921.</h1>

        <p>Barbados                                           Government  House.<br />
                                                            10th  June 1921.<br />
		Confidential</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>       Sir,<br />
       I  have the honour to acknowledge the receipt<br />
       of your despatch, No.100 of 19th April, transmitting<br />
       certain  correspondence with His Majesty’s High<br />
       Commissioner  at Constantinople in regard to the murder<br />
       of one Alexander Sobers in that City.</p>
        <ol start="2">
          <li>I have caused discreet enquiries to be made and I find Alexander  Sobers was a Barbadian, residing<br />
          in Rock Hall  Village in  the Parish of St Lucy, who  left<br />
          Barbados many  years ago.  He is believed to have<br />
          married a white  woman and to have several children. He<br />
          has six sisters  residing in St Lucy.  There is no<br />
          possibility of  their being able to maintain the family<br />
          if sent to  Barbados and it is very unlikely that a<br />
          white woman, the  widow of a coloured man, would be<br />
          able to make a  decent living in this Colony. We have<br />
          had to assist  several white women who were married to <br />
          coloured men to  return to their homes as they found the<br />
          conditions of  life unsuitable here.</li>
