		<h1>Petition from a committee of free 'coloured' inhabitants of Montserrat, extract. Montserrat, 1823.</h1>
		  
		<p>Catalogue reference: CO 318/76 folio 150.</p>

		<p>Montserrat                              <br />
                                                            To Henry Maddock and Fortunatus<br />
                                                            Dwarris Esquires, His Majesty’s<br />
                                                            Commissioners of Inquiry into the<br />

                                                            Windward and Leeward Islands.</p>
        <p>We whose names are hereunto  subscribed, being a Committee of the Free Coloured Inhabitants of this Island  of Montserrat, Humbly beg leave to represent, that they in common with this  description of His Majestys Subjects in the other Islands, are grieved  at the want of those Rights and Privileges to which they are entitled as good  and faithful Subjects – And that they have Petitioned the Legislature of the  Island, to remove all those unjust restraints and disabilities which are  imposed upon them by the Usages and Customs of the Island, and to place them on  an equal footing with the rest of the inhabitants, not more obedient to the  Laws, faithful in their Allegiance, or more deeply interested in the Welfare  and good Government of the Island, than are the Free Coloured Inhabitants. But  from the feeling of Opposition manifested by the House of Assembly (the  principal source of relief in such cases) on the presentation of our Petition,  We are induced to Conclude that no favourable attention will be paid to our  just complaints. </p>
