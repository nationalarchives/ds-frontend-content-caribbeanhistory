        <p>That Your  Petitioner humbly states that he ought not to have been so convicted and  sentenced because no evidence was produced or shewn to the Court or Jury of  Your Petitioner having given or caused to be given any <u>person or persons  drug pounded glass or other deleterious matter</u> to the person or persons  named in the said Indictments and because the giving or causing to be given any  poison or poisonous drug pounded glass or other deleterious matter in the  practice of Obeah with which your Petitioner was charged by the said  Indictments is not punishable by the said Act which was intended to prevent the  belief in pretences to Obeah and which only punishes and applies to the mixing  or preparing with an intent to give or cause to be given any poison or  poisonous drug pounded glass or otherÂ   deleterious matter in the practice of Obeah with which Offences your  Petitioner was not charged by the said Indictments and because the Courts in  the said Indictments which charged Your Petitioner with having in his  possession certain materials notoriously used in the practice of Obeah are  uncertain and insufficient and ought to have specified the nature kind or  description of materials in order that Your Petitioner might have been enabled  to prepare his defence accordingly and to plead his conviction in bar of any  other prosecution for the same Offence and because (the said Courts not  charging Your Petitioner with having in his possession any of the Articles or  things specified in the said Act) no proof was produced or shewn to the Court  or Jury of any other materials in the  possession of Your Petitioner being in notorious use in the practice of Obeah.</p>
