       	<p>TRINIDAD.<br />
       	  By  His Excellency THE RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR GEORGE FITZGERALD HILL,<br />
       	  L.S.                 Baronet  Colonel of the Londonderry Regiment of Militia,<br />
       	  Lieutenant-Governor  and Commander-in-Chief in and over the said<br />
       	  G.F.HILL         Island and its Dependencies,  Vice-Admiral thereof, &amp;c.  &amp;c.<br />
       	  _____________________________<br />
       	  A PROCLAMATION.            <br />
       	  ______________________________<br />
       	  I, THE  RIGHT HONOURABLE SIR GEORGE FITZGERALD HILL, Baronet, Lieutenant-Governor of  the said Island, having received the commands of Her Most Gracious Majesty the  Queen, through the Colonial Secretary of<br />
       	  State, to  communicate to the Apprenticed Labourers of this Colony the feelings of Interest and  solicitude entertained by Her Majesty and all Classes of Her Subjects for their  welfare, and their moral and religious improvement, and at<br />
       	  the same  time to explain to them their duties, and to guard them against the  misconceptions which might arise from imperfect or erroneous information  communicated to them, do hereby declare and proclaim, that Her Most Gracious <br />
       	  Majesty  and both Houses of the British Parliament, Her Majesty’s Ministers, and all  Classes of Her Subjects in Great Britain, have felt, and continue to feel the  deepest interest in the Improvement and Prosperity of the Apprenticed<br />
       	  Labourers  in this Island; and that this feeling has been much increased by the quiet,  orderly, and industrious behaviour by which they have, in general, been  distinguished since the commencement of their term of Apprenticeship on<br />
       	  the 1st  of August, 1834. It is this feeling which induced Her Majesty the Queen and Her  Parliament to pay a large sum of money to their respective Employers, to secure  the entire Freedom of all Apprentices in Six Years after the 1st of  August, 1834, and the Freedom of all Domestics and Tradesmen in Four Years from  that time. But as information has reached me that the Field Apprentices on some  Estates believe that their period of Apprenticed Labour for their Employers is  to cease on the 1st of August next, it has become my duty to  undeceive them, and to tell them the Truth.</p>
