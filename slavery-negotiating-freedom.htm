<meta name="DC.description" content="This exhibition looks at the history of the British Caribbean through Colonial Office government documents held at The National Archives, focusing on the period between 1780 and 1926. Topics included are the Transatlantic Slave Trade, colonialism, political conflicts, and struggles for freedom. Documents used include public and private correspondence, petitions, maps, reports, sketches and photographs. The website contains some 50 images, as well as a Glossary, Bibliography, and Links to other sites.This page is about the Transatlantic Slave Trade and plantation slavery, and illustrates the way in which enslaved peoples rebelled against their enslavement.  The British slave trade officially ended in 1807, but it was not until 1834 that slavery ended, followed by a period of apprenticeship with freedom coming in 1838; indentured labourers were used in place of slaves." />

Those engaged in the trade were driven by the huge financial gain to be made, both in the Caribbean and at home in Britain. </p>

		<p>Enslaved people constantly rebelled against slavery right up until <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#emancipation">emancipation</a> in 1834. Most spectacular were the slave revolts during the 18th and 19th centuries, including: Tacky’s rebellion in 1760s Jamaica, the Haitian Revolution (1789), Fedon’s 1790s revolution in Grenada, the 1816 Barbados slave revolt led by Bussa, and the major 1831 slave revolt in Jamaica led by Sam Sharpe. Also voices of dissent began emerging in Britain, highlighting the poor conditions of enslaved people. Whilst the <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#abolition">Abolition</a> movement was growing, so was the opposition by those with financial interests in the Caribbean. </p>

		<p>The British slave trade officially ended in 1807, making the buying and selling of slaves from Africa illegal; however, slavery itself had not ended. It was not until 1 August 1834 that slavery ended in the British Caribbean following legislation passed the previous year. This was followed by a period of <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#apprenticeship">apprenticeship</a> with freedom coming in 1838.</p>

		<p> Even after the end of slavery and apprenticeship the Caribbean was not totally free. Former enslaved people received no compensation and had limited representation in the <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#legislature">legislatures</a>. <a onclick="PRO_openPopupWindow(this.href,'popup','625','250','status=yes,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes','yes'); return false;" title="View the glossary entry for this term - this link will open in a new window" href="/caribbeanhistory/popups/glossary.htm#indentured_labour">Indentured labour</a> from India and China was introduced after slavery. This system resulted in much abuse and was not abolished until the early part of the 20th century. After indenture, Indians and Africans struggled to own land and create their own communities.</p>
